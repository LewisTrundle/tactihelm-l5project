# Interim Report

## Description
> In the first stage of the MSci project you work on a one-to-one basis with your supervisor to develop a project and explore the feasibility of your approach. At the same time, you survey relevant research literature. The interim report is the first milestone of the MSci project.
>
> The interim report should include a clear statement of the research problem; a literature survey; and a proof of concept, feasibility study, or appropriate prototype to demonstrate you are capable of completing the proposed project.

> 5. Progress: give a report on your progress thus far, describing the state of your feasibility study, proof of concept, or prototype that demonstrate you are capable of completing your project.
