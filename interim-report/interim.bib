abstract = {In recent years, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) have assisted in the decrease of road traffic fatalities, particularly amongst passenger car occupants. Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, moped riders and motorcyclists, however, have not been that much in focus when developing ITS. Therefore, there is a clear need for ITS which specifically address VRUs as an integrated element of the traffic system. This paper presents the results of a quantitative safety impact assessment of five systems that were estimated to have high potential to improve the safety of cyclists, namely: Blind Spot Detection (BSD), Bicycle to Vehicle communication (B2V), Intersection safety (INS), Pedestrian and Cyclist Detection System+Emergency Braking (PCDS+EBR) and VRU Beacon System (VBS). An ex-ante assessment method proposed by Kulmala (2010) targeted to assess the effects of ITS for cars was applied and further developed in this study to assess the safety impacts of ITS specifically designed for VRUs. The main results of the assessment showed that all investigated systems affect cyclist safety in a positive way by preventing fatalities and injuries. The estimates considering 2012 accident data and full penetration showed that the highest effects could be obtained by the implementation of PCDS+EBR and B2V, whereas VBS had the lowest effect. The estimated yearly reduction in cyclist fatalities in the EU-28 varied between 77 and 286 per system. A forecast for 2030, taking into accounts the estimated accident trends and penetration rates, showed the highest effects for PCDS+EBR and BSD.}

abstract = {Despite advances in vehicle technology and road modernization, traffic accidents are a huge global issue, causing deaths and injuries, especially among pedestrians and cyclists. This often happens due to pedestrians and cyclists in drivers' blind spots or distractions delaying drivers' reactions. Therefore, timely warning drivers about critical situations is important to increase traffic safety. New edge computing and communication technologies have been proposed to reduce latency in critical IoT systems. However, state-of-the-art solutions either do not focus on traffic safety or do not consider low-latency requirements in this context.We propose InTraSafEd5G (Increasing Traffic Safety with Edge and 5G) to address these issues. InTraSafEd5G performs real-time edge analytics to detect critical situations and deliver early warnings to drivers. After describing our design choices, we provide a prototype implementation and evaluate its performance in a real-world setup. The evaluation shows that InTraSafEd5G can (i) detect critical situations in real-time and (ii) notify affected drivers in 108.73ms on average using 5G, which is within expected latency requirements of road safety IoT applications. Our solution shows a promising step towards increasing overall traffic safety and supporting decision-making in critical situations.},

abstract = {Cycling is an environmentally friendly means of transport with growing popularity. However, there is still potential for increased road safety in the future. We argue that by making assistance systems available to cyclists, accidents could be prevented. In this paper, we focus on potential accidents caused by vehicle doors opening in a cyclist’s path of travel, which can lead to serious injuries to the cyclist. Using a mixed-methods approach, we explored how messages informing about a potentially opening door ahead are perceived and understood regarding usability and intuitiveness in a bicycle simulator study (N=24). We investigated how visual messages, visual messages and auditory icons, and visual and voice messages on a head-mounted device are subjectively perceived. We also assessed our participants’ attitudes toward using such systems and mixed reality simulations for bicycle safety research in general. Our results show that participants preferred visual messages and auditory cues and found these types of notifications more enjoyable than visual messages alone. Furthermore, the results suggest that such a system would be used while cycling. Participants agreed that mixed reality simulation is suitable for testing/evaluating novel support systems and finding initial insights in the first step but confirmed that real-world testing on the road is mandatory nonetheless.},

abstract = {An on-bike warning system has great potential to increase safety of cyclists. For an effective warning system, the implementation of warning signals is fundamental. However, more knowledge about the cyclist specific design of warnings and the influence of warnings on the cyclist is needed. To analyze the benefit of warnings in conflicts and the reaction pattern of cyclists we conducted a test-track experiment. We evaluated the data of 62 participants who were divided into three warning groups (between-subjects) and encountered different situations (within-subjects). The warning groups either received acoustic, vibro-tactile or no warnings. The situation variable consisted of three conflicts and two false warnings in the groups with warnings. We measured significantly shorter reaction times of persons who received acoustic and vibro-tactile warnings compared to the persons without warning. Furthermore, acoustic warnings led to shorter reaction times compared to vibro-tactile warnings. The reaction pattern was described by different bicycle dynamics variables. It was mostly influenced by the situation and rarely by the warning group. Based on the velocity curves and reaction times we identified learning effects describing how the warned participants adopted the warning system over the five situations. These findings indicate that a warning system offers great safety benefits to cyclists. Based on the current results, acoustic warnings are recommended when an urgent reaction is required.}

Relevant (cognitive) abilities at the first two levels must be acquired and automatized through extensive experience. The processes which are not yet automatized may claim attention and will, therefore, interfere with other processes demanding attention. In this experiment, subjects of various ages and bicycling experience participated. The hypothesis was verified that novice cyclists cannot accomplish traffic-relevant cognitive tasks while they ride a bicycle; possible countermeasures were discussed.},

Twenty-five participants completed a track on a bicycle while listening to music with two standard earbuds, with one earbud, and with two in-earbuds. Conditions with high tempo music and loud volume were also included in the experiment, as were two mobile phone conditions, one in which participants operated the phone hand held and one handsfree condition. Cycle speed was not affected by listening to music, but was reduced in the telephone conditions. In general the response to auditory signals worsened when participants listened to music, in particular when listening with in-earbuds loud auditory stop signals were missed in 68% of the cases. However, when listening with only one standard earbud performance was not affected. In the conditions when participants listened to high volume and to high tempo music, the auditory stop signal was also heard in significantly fewer cases. Completing a task on the mobile phone, using both handheld and handsfree sets, resulted in increased response time to an auditory stop signal and also reduced overall auditory perception. Furthermore, handsfree operation only had minor advantages opposed to hand held operation, with only response time to an auditory stop signal resulting in faster performance. This is likely to be related to the fact that both hands could be used for braking. It is concluded that listening to music worsens auditory perception, in particular if in-earbuds are used. Furthermore, both handheld and handsfree operation of mobile phones has a negative effect on perception, potentially forming a threat to cyclist traffic safety.}

abstract = {Going on excursions to explore unfamiliar environments by bike is a popular activity in many places in this world. To investigate the nature of exploratory bicycle trips, we studied tourists on their excursions on a famous vacation island. We found that existing navigation systems are either not helpful or discourage exploration. We therefore propose Tacticycle, a conceptual prototype of a user interface for a bicycle navigation system. Relying on a minimal set of navigation cues, it helps staying oriented while supporting spontaneous navigation and exploration at the same time. In cooperation with a bike rental, we rented the Tacticycle prototype to tourists who took it on their actual excursions. The results show that they always felt oriented and encouraged to playfully explore the island, providing a rich, yet relaxed travel experience. On the basis of these findings, we argue that exploratory trips can be very well supported by providing minimal navigation cues only.},

abstract = {Cycling is a common leisure time sports in touristic regions. For us it was the question how tourists actually find their paths in the area and what kind of navigation aids might be helpful to them. In a requirements study on a touristic island we learned that tourists rather explore the environment spontaneously than efficiently navigating from on place to another such as the beach or the light house, and just cycle on without much map or navigation aid. While exploring the area, the cyclists however, sometimes lose their orientation which they compensate for by accepting detours. We designed and developed an orientation aid, Tacticycle that does not influence the cycling experience but improve the orientation and awareness of the overall direction. In order to ensure the cyclists' safety two vibrotactile actuators are used to indicate directions and announce the presence of interesting places. In two field studies we showed that despite the accuracy of the indicated direction being rather coarse, the tactile user interface allows cyclists to reach a presented destination easily. The visitor of the demo can experience a virtual cycling tour supported by the Tacticycle demonstrator.},

To investigate the potential of tactile navigation for cyclists, we have designed and implemented Vibrobelt. This belt, worn around the waist, gives waypoint, distance and endpoint information using directional tactile cues. We evaluated Vibrobelt by comparing it to a visual navigation application. Twenty participants were asked to cycle two routes, each route with a different application. We measured the spatial knowledge acquisition and analyzed the visual focus of the participants. We found that Vibrobelt was successful at guiding all participants to their destinations over an unfamiliar route. Participants using Vibrobelt showed a lower error rate for recognizing images from the route than users of the visual system. Users of the visual system were generally navigating faster, and were better at recalling the route, showing a higher contextual route understanding. The endpoint distance encoding was not always correctly interpreted. Future research will improve Vibrobelt by making a clearer distinction between waypoint and endpoint information, and will test users in more complex navigational situations.},

abstract = {Introduction: In the Netherlands, a survey was set up to monitor the extent of the use of portable, electronic devices while cycling amongst different age groups of cyclists and to estimate the possible consequences for safety. Method: The main research questions concerned age differences in the self-reported use of electronic devices while cycling, self-reported crash involvement and risk, and self-reported compensatory behaviour. Teen cyclists (12–17years) and young adult cyclists (18–34years) were more frequent users, and also more indiscriminate users of portable devices while cycling than middle-aged and older adult cyclists (35–49years; 50+ years). Results: After statistical correction for influences on crash risk of urbanization level, weekly time spent cycling, and cycling in more demanding traffic situations, the odds of being involved in a bicycle crash were estimated to be higher for teen cyclists and young adult cyclists who used electronic devices on every trip compared to same age groups cyclists who never used these devices. For middle-aged and older adult cyclists, the use of portable electronic devices was not a significant predictor of bicycle crashes, but frequency of cycling in demanding traffic situations was. Possible implications for education or legal measures are discussed. Impact on Industry: Results may inform researchers, policy makers, and cyclists themselves. Educational campaigns may use risk information to warn young cyclists about risk of device use while cycling.}

abstract = {Cycling continues to grow in popularity, both as a means to commute and for exercise. While there is a plethora of research studying technology use in vehicular travel, cycling remains a relatively understudied area—especially within HCI. We conducted an ethnography, adopting an ethnomethodological lens, to study cyclists as they use their bicycles for routine purposes. Through the use of a handlebar-mounted 360-degree action video camera, we conducted our study longitudinally with participants over a number of weeks. Our analysis explicates our participants accountable use of different electronic technologies while on the go and in this paper we present four fragments of their use of different technologies as exemplars from our corpus. Our paper offers insights into the use of technology on bicycles, including how cyclists select moments of opportunity to use technology for different purposes. We conclude by offering design implications for the design of interactive technologies for cyclists.},

abstract = {Current apps for cyclists follow the "stop-to-interact" paradigm, neglecting that people interact with their smartphones in motion. We conducted two studies to explore paradigms for interaction that can be applied while cycling. In an enactment study, participants freely explored movements suitable for interaction while using a bicycle trainer and discussed respective requirements and constraints. The analysis of the interaction movements and the group discussion showed that users preferred to keep their hands on the handlebars while performing subtle gestures with their fingers. Based on this we performed an outdoor study focused on interacting with a smartphone game while riding a bicycle, using three interaction options: buttons on the handlebars, the phone's touchscreen, and a wristband activated by flipping the wrist. Using buttons resulted in a significantly lower physical demand and significantly lower frustration compared to the other alternatives, as well as better task performance compared to interacting using the wristband.},

abstract = { This article includes two sections that address the relevance of codes (verbal-spatial) and modalities (auditory-visual) in the multiple-resource model to the prediction of task interference. The first section describes an experiment in which either verbal or spatial decision tasks, responded to with either voice or keypress, were time-shared with second-order tracking. Decision problem difficulty was manipulated, and subjective workload as well as performance measures were assessed. The results provided support for the importance of the dichotomy between verbal and spatial processing codes in accounting for task interference. Interference with tracking was consistently greater and difficulty/performance trade-offs were stronger when the spatial decision task was performed and the manual response was used.The second section reviews literature on the interference between a continuous visual task and a discrete task whose modality is either auditory or visual. The review suggests that scanning produces a dominant cost to intramodal configurations when visual channels are separated in space; when visual separation is eliminated, however, the differences between cross-modal and intramodal performance may be best accounted for by a mechanism of preemption. Discrete auditory stimuli preempt the processing of a continuous visual task, facilitating their own processing at the expense of the continuous task. Such preemption does not occur when visual discrete and continuous tasks are time-shared. }

abstract = {Navigation systems for cyclists are commonly screen-based devices mounted on the handlebar which show map information. Typically, adult cyclists have to explicitly look down for directions. This can be distracting and challenging for children, given their developmental differences in motor and perceptual-motor abilities compared with adults. To address this issue, we designed different unimodal cues and explored their suitability for child cyclists through two experiments. In the first experiment, we developed an indoor bicycle simulator and compared auditory, light, and vibrotactile navigation cues. In the second experiment, we investigated these navigation cues in-situ in an outdoor practice test track using a mid-size tricycle. To simulate road distractions, children were given an additional auditory task in both experiments. We found that auditory navigational cues were the most understandable and the least prone to navigation errors. However, light and vibrotactile cues might be useful for educating younger child cyclists.},

To facilitate road safety for children, we explore the use of multimodal warning signals to increase their awareness and prime action in critical situations. We developed a bicycle simulator instrumented with these signals and conducted two controlled experiments. We found that participants spent significantly more time perceiving visual than auditory or vibrotactile cues. Unimodal signals were the easiest to recognize and suitable for encoding directional cues.

ABSTRACT = {Numerous statistics show that cyclists are often involved in road traffic accidents, often with serious outcomes. One potential hazard of cycling, especially in cities, is &ldquo;dooring&rdquo;&mdash;passing parked vehicles that still have occupants inside. These occupants could open the vehicle door unexpectedly in the cyclist&rsquo;s path&mdash;requiring a quick evasive response by the cyclist to avoid a collision. Dooring can be very poorly anticipated; as a possible solution, we propose in this work a system that notifies the cyclist of opening doors based on a networked intelligent transportation infrastructure. In a user study with a bicycle simulator (N = 24), we examined the effects of three user interface designs compared to a baseline (no notifications) on cycling behavior (speed and lateral position), perceived safety, and ease of use. Awareness messages (either visual message, visual message + auditory icon, or visual + voice message) were displayed on a smart bicycle helmet at different times before passing a parked, still-occupied vehicle. Our participants found the notifications of potential hazards very easy to understand and appealing and felt that the alerts could help them navigate traffic more safely. Those concepts that (additionally) used auditory icons or voice messages were preferred. In addition, the lateral distance increased significantly when a potentially opening door was indicated. In these situations, cyclists were able to safely pass the parked vehicle without braking. In summary, we are convinced that notification systems, such as the one presented here, are an important component for increasing road safety, especially for vulnerable road users.},

abstract = {While driving many tasks compete for the attention of the user, mainly via the audio and visual channel. When designing systems depending upon providing feedback to users (e.g., navigation systems), it is a crucial prerequisite to minimize influence on and distraction from the driving task. This becomes even more important when designing systems for the use on motorbikes; space for output devices is scarce, as people are wearing helmets visual feedback is often difficult due to lighting conditions, and audio feedback is limited. In a first step we aimed at creating an understanding as to how information could be communicated in a meaningful way using vibrotactile signals. Therefore, we investigated suitable positions of actuators on the hand, appropriate length of the vibration stimulus, and different vibration patterns. We built a first prototype with 4 vibration actuators attached to the fingertips and asked 4 participants to test our prototype while driving. With this work we envision to lay the foundations for vibrotactile support in navigation systems.},

Potential negative effects are that warnings may occur rarely, startling the driver and adding to cognitive load and stress, or alternatively, warnings may occur frequently and be ignored by the driver. To minimize negative effects, four design concepts are considered: (a) a graded sequence of warnings, from mild to severe, (b) a parallel change in modality, from visual to auditory, (c) individualization of warnings, and (d) a headway – distance to lead car – display. }

abstract = { Many new in-vehicle systems focus on accident prevention by facilitating the driving task. One such driving aid is an in-vehicle collision avoidance warning system (IVCAWS), used to alert the driver to an impending collision. Our study evaluated the effects of an imperfect IVCAWS both on driver headway maintenance and on driver behavior in response to warning system errors. Our results showed that drivers tend to overestimate their headway and consequently drive with short and potentially dangerous headways, and that IVCAWSs are a useful tool for educating drivers to stimate headway more accurately. Moreover, our study showed that after a relatively short exposure to the system, drivers were able to maintain longer and safer headways for at least six months. The practical implications of these results are that the use of an IVCAWS should be considered for inclusion in driver education and training programs. }

abstract = { An experiment was conducted to determine the effects of an in-vehicle collision avoidance warning system (IVCAWS) on driver performance. A driving simulator was driven by 135 licensed drivers. Of these, 120 received alerts from the IVCAWS when their headway to a lead car was less than 2s, and the other 15 (the control group) received no alerts. Drivers received varied alert interfaces: auditory, visual, and multimodal. The system had varied levels of reliability, determined by both false alarm rate and failure of the IVCAWS to alert to short headway. Results indicated that the IVCAWS led to safer (longer) headway maintenance. High false alarm rates induced drivers to slow down unnecessarily; large numbers of missed alerts did not have any significant impact on drivers. Driver acceptance of the system was mixed. Interface played a role in driver reliance on the system, with the multimodal interfaces generating least reliance. Actual or potential applications of this research include IVCAWS interface selection for greater system efficacy and user acceptance and the advisability of implementation, even of imperfect systems, for drivers who seek to maintain a safer headway. }

ABSTRACT = {“Out of the body” tactile illusion refers to the phenomenon in which one can perceive tactility as if emanating from a location external to the body without any stimulator present there. Taking advantage of such a tactile illusion is one way to provide and realize richer interaction feedback without employing and placing actuators directly at all stimulation target points. However, to further explore its potential, it is important to better understand the underlying physiological and neural mechanism. As such, we measured the brain wave patterns during such tactile illusion and mapped out the corresponding brain activation areas. Participants were given stimulations at different levels with the intention to create veridical (i.e., non-illusory) and phantom sensations at different locations along an external hand-held virtual ruler. The experimental data and analysis indicate that both veridical and illusory sensations involve, among others, the parietal lobe, one of the most important components in the tactile information pathway. In addition, we found that as for the illusory sensation, there is an additional processing resulting in the delay for the ERP (event-related potential) and involvement by the limbic lobe. These point to regarding illusion as a memory and recognition task as a possible explanation. The present study demonstrated some basic understanding; how humans process “virtual” objects and the way associated tactile illusion is generated will be valuable for HCI (Human-Computer Interaction).},

abstract = {Digital maps and route descriptions on a PDA have become very popular for navigation, not the least with the advent of the iPhone and its Google Maps application. A visual support for wayfinding, however, is not reasonable or even possible all the time. A pedestrian must pay attention to traffic on the street, a hiker should concentrate on the narrow trail, and a blind person relies on other modalities to find her way. To overcome these limitations, we developed a non-visual support for wayfinding that guides and keeps a mobile user en route by a tactile display. We designed a belt with vibrators that indicates directions and deviations from the path in an accurate and unobtrusive way. Our first user evaluation showed that on an open field without any landmarks the participants stayed well to given test routes and that wayfinding support is possible with our Tactile Wayfinder.},

abstract = {Presenting waypoint navigation on a visual display is not suited for all situations. The present experiments investigate if it is feasible to present the navigation information on a tactile display. Important design issue of the display is how direction and distance information must be coded. Important usability issues are the resolution of the display and its usefulness in vibrating environments. In a pilot study with 12 pedestrians, different distance-coding schemes were compared. The schemes translated distance to vibration rhythm while the direction was translated into vibration location. The display consisted of eight tactors around the user's waist. The results show that mapping waypoint direction on the location of vibration is an effective coding scheme that requires no training, but that coding for distance does not improve performance compared to a control condition with no distance information. In Experiment 2, the usefulness of the tactile display was shown in two case studies with a helicopter and a fast boat.},

abstract = {A vibrotactile display, consisting of eight vibrating elements or tactors mounted in a driver’s seat, was tested in a driving simulator. Participants drove with visual, tactile and multimodal navigation displays through a built-up area. Workload and the reaction time to navigation messages were measured for normal and high workload conditions. The results demonstrated that the tactile navigation display reduces the driver’s workload compared to the visual display, particularly in the high workload group. The fastest reaction was found with the multimodal display. It was concluded that this study quantitatively supports the claims that a localised vibration or tap is an intuitive way to present direction information, and that employing the tactile channel may release other heavily loaded sensory channels, therefore potentially providing a major safety enhancement.}

abstract = {A group of friends visiting a crowded and noisy music festival is an example of a situation where knowing the location of other people is important, but where external factors, such as darkness or noise, can limit the ability to keep track of the others. By combining theories about situation awareness and cognitive processing we inferred that communicating information via the sense of touch is a promising approach in such situations. We therefore investigated how to present the location of several people using a tactile torso display. In particular we focused on encoding spatial distances in the tactile signals. We experimentally compared encoding spatial distances in the rhythm, duration, and intensity of a tactile signal. Our findings show that all parameters are suited to encode distances. None of it was clearly outperformed. We then embedded our tactile location encoding into a fast-paced 3D multiplayer game. In this game, team play and the awareness of the team members' locations are crucial for the success in the game. The results provides evidence that the locations of the team members could be processed effectively despite the game's high cognitive demands. In addition, the team equipped with the tactile display showed a better team play and a higher situation awareness.},

Model estimation results show that many factors potentially affect the likelihood of severe injuries in bicycle/motor-vehicle crashes including bicyclist and driver race and gender, alcohol-impaired bicyclists or drivers, older bicyclists, riding or driving on the wrong side of road, drivers’ unsafe speeding, bicyclist not wearing helmet, and so on. The findings of this research point toward the need to further study the contributing factors on the bicyclist injury severities.}

    abstract = "{Background: The research literature was systematically reviewed and results were summarized from studies assessing bicycle helmet effectiveness to mitigate head, serious head, face, neck and fatal head injury in a crash or fall.Methods: Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, COMPENDEX and SCOPUS) were searched for relevant, peer-reviewed articles in English. Included studies reported medically diagnosed head, face and neck injuries where helmet use was known. Non-approved helmets were excluded where possible. Summary odds ratios (OR) were obtained using multivariate meta-regression models stratified by injury type and severity. Time trends and publication bias were assessed.Results: A total of 43 studies met inclusion criteria and 40 studies were included in the meta-analysis with data from over 64 000 injured cyclists. For cyclists involved in a crash or fall, helmet use was associated with odds reductions for head (OR = 0.49, 95\\% confidence interval (CI): 0.42–0.57), serious head (OR = 0.31, 95\\% CI: 0.25–0.37), face (OR = 0.67, 95\\% CI: 0.56–0.81) and fatal head injury (OR = 0.35, 95\\% CI: 0.14–0.88). No clear evidence of an association between helmet use and neck injury was found (OR = 0.96, 95\\% CI: 0.74–1.25). There was no evidence of time trends or publication bias.Conclusions: Bicycle helmet use was associated with reduced odds of head injury, serious head injury, facial injury and fatal head injury. The reduction was greater for serious or fatal head injury. Neck injury was rare and not associated with helmet use. These results support the use of strategies to increase the uptake of bicycle helmets as part of a comprehensive cycling safety plan.}",

The use of bicycle helmets was found to reduce head injury by 48%, serious head injury by 60%, traumatic brain injury by 53%, face injury by 23%, and the total number of killed or seriously injured cyclists by 34%. Bicycle helmets were not found to have any statistically significant effect on cervical spine injury. There is no indication that the results from bicycle helmet studies are affected by a lack of control for confounding variables, time trend bias or publication bias. The results do not indicate that bicycle helmet effects are different between adult cyclists and children. Bicycle helmet effects may be somewhat larger when bicycle helmet wearing is mandatory than otherwise; however, helmet wearing rates were not found to be related to bicycle helmet effectiveness. It is also likely that bicycle helmets have larger effects among drunk cyclists than among sober cyclists, and larger effects in single bicycle crashes than in collisions with motor vehicles. In summary, the results suggest that wearing a helmet while cycling is highly recommendable, especially in situations with an increased risk of single bicycle crashes, such as on slippery or icy roads.}

Mandatory bicycle helmet legislation increases helmet use but is a controversial measure. Results from 21 studies of the effects of mandatory bicycle helmet legislation on injuries among crash involved cyclists were investigated by means of meta-analysis and the effects of several potential biases were investigated. The summary effect of mandatory bicycle helmet legislation for all cyclists on head injuries is a statistically significant reduction by 20% (95% confidence interval [−27; −13]). Larger effects were found for serious head injury (−55%; 95% confidence interval; [−78; −8]). Among children, larger effects were found when legislation applies to all cyclists than when it applies to children only. There is no clear indication of the results being affected by publication bias. Publication bias may exist, but any existing biases seem to more or less outweigh each other. Results from meta-analysis do not indicate that the results are systematically affected by a lack of control for time trend bias, choice of comparison group or study design (before-after vs. case control). Summary effects may be somewhat overestimated because of a lack of control for potential confounding variables in some of the studies. However, such a bias, if it exists, is not likely to be large. Empirical evidence for the hypotheses that mandatory bicycle helmet legislation deters people from cycling and that helmet wearing leads to behavioral adaptation is mixed. In summary, mandatory bicycle helmet legislation can be expected to reduce head injury among crash involved cyclists. Some adverse effects may occur, but will not necessarily be large or long-lasting. People who may be deterred from cycling, are among those with the highest injury risk and the smallest health effects from cycling. If the overall goal is to improve safety for all cyclists and to increase cycling, mandatory bicycle helmet legislation should be supplemented by other measures, especially improved bicycle infrastructure.}

In a forced-choice discrimination task, participants judged whether the second of two intervals was shorter or longer than the first interval. Two pulses defined the intervals. The pulse was either a vibro-tactile burst presented to the fingertip, or a foveally presented white square. The comparisons were made for uni-modal and cross-modal intervals. We used four levels of standard interval durations in the range of 100–800 ms.The results showed that tactile empty intervals must be 8.5\% shorter to be perceived as long as visual intervals. This cross-modal bias is larger for small intervals and decreases with increasing standard intervals. The Weber fractions (the threshold divided by the standard interval) are 20\% and are constant over the standard intervals. This indicates that the Weber law holds for the range of interval lengths tested. Furthermore, the Weber fractions are consistent over uni-modal and cross-modal comparisons, which indicates that there is no additional noise involved in the cross-modal comparisons. }

abstract = {Visual and auditory displays successfully complement each other presenting information in car navigation systems. However, they distract the visual and auditory attention of the driver, which is needed in many primary driving tasks, such as maneuvering the car or observing the traffic. Tactile interfaces can form an alternative way to display spatial information. The way of how exactly information should be presented in a vibro-tactile way is explored rarely. In this paper we investigate three different designs of vibro-tactile stimulation to convey distance information to the driver using a tactile waist belt. We explore the tactile parameters intensity, rhythm, duration, and body location for encoding the distance information. We conduct a comparative experiment on a real navigation scenario in an urban environment to evaluate our designs.In our study we discovered that rhythm and duration are suitable parameters to generate tactile stimulation for encoding distance information. In this way the driver perceives countable vibro-tactile pulses, which indicate the distance in turn by turn instructions. The approach is found be simple way of encoding complex navigational information.},
