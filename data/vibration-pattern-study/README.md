# Vibration Pattern Study





ask participants to identify whether a simulated vehicle is "near" or "far" - abritrary terms

## Vibratactile Decisions

### System Design Decisions
Number:
need to find optimal number of tactors.


#### Tactor Design Decisions
Placement
Already chosen as helmet. where the vibration is presented specifically in the chosen location.

Timing 
(when the vibration is on and when it is off)

Frequency

Amplitude


	- Number of levels (is it reasonable for a participant to be able to identify the correct level)
	- Intensity of vibration (would the vibration cause discomfort or be too small to detect)
