# User Survey
In-order to assess what end users of Tactihelm would like to see from the product, it is necessary to first understand cyclists' attitudes and behaviours towards safety while cycling.

The survey was split into four key categories, as shown below. There was a mixture of open response, Likert scale, and multiple choice questions, taking approximately 6 minutes to complete. These were distributed to various cycling groups around Glasgow. Survey participants were urged to answer as truthly and honestly as possible. It was not our intention to judge any participants' answers on their safety, legality, or 'sensibility' - instead we only seeked to gather valuable insights into cyclists' behaviours.

All data collected remained compliant with GDPR.


## Demographic
Basis demographic information is needed incase any differences arises between different demographic groups. The following information is collected:
>* How old are you?
>* What is your gender?
>* Where do you currently live?

It is known that age and gender impacts a cyclists behaviour. Location also impacts a cyclists attitudes and behaviour due to differences in the countries laws and infrastructure.


## Cycling Habits and Experiences
This section aimed to gather insights into participants own experiences with cycling. Insights such as cycling frequency, environment, reasoning, and injuries are acquired. The following questions are asked:
>* How often do you cycle?
>* In which environments do you regularly cycle?
>* What are your main reasons for cycling?
>* Have you ever been injured whilst cycling (minor injury, major injury, never)
>* If you answered yes to the previous question - can you briefly describe (in one or two sentences) how the accident occurred and if it could have been prevented in anyway?


## Safety Techniques and Equipment
This section focuses on safety techniques and equipment used by cyclists.

From the first question, we hope to gather insights into how cyclists keep themselves safe on the road via their own actions. Participants are asked to read the following statements, then select how much they agree (from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree). The statements are as follows:
>* I always wear a helmet while cycling
>* I never listen to music/wear headphones while cycling
>* I very rarely take a hand off the handlebars unless to perform a quick action (such as indicating)
>* I always keep my eyes on the road to stay vigilant

These first four questions aims to identify what channels are available to a cyclist for interaction or communication (i.e. are they able to hear, see, or use their hands).

>* I regularly perform shoulder checks to be aware of my surroundings
>* I am always aware when a car is close to me while cycling

These questions seeks to assess the need for a device which informs cyclists if a car from behind is approaching. This device would perform shoulder checks for you.

>* I always cycle 2-3 feet away from parked cars
>* I am always aware when I'm in another vehicles blind spot

These questions assesses the possibility of using Tactihelm to inform cyclists if they are in a vehicles blind spot.

>* I always feel safe when cycling on the road with other vehicles

This question simply aims to get a general feel as to how cyclists feel towards sharing roads with other users.

<br>

It then asks:
>* If you did not answer 'Always' to the statement 'I wear a helmet while cycling', what are your reasons for not wearing a helmet?

<br>This section asks about what safety equipment and technology participants use. Additionally, if they use a bike radar, if they could state the brand they use and give their opinions on it.
> * Select all the safety equipment and technology that you regularly use while cycling?
>* If you answered yes to having a bike radar, which brand/device do you use?
>* If you answered yes to having a bike radar, how useful do you find it? Does it improve your safety? What do you wish could be improved?

<br>

The final question asks:
>* What challenges do you experience which makes cycling feel unsafe (give as many reasons as you wish)?


## Tactihelm
The final section gives a brief description of Tactihelm and then asks participants to share their thoughts. This questions encourages both positive and negative comments to be shared, so that we may properly initially evaluate Tactihelms' desire in the target market.
