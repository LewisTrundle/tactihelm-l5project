# User Survey
In-order to assess what end users of Tactihelm would like to see from the product, it is necessary to first understand cyclists' attitudes and behaviours towards safety while cycling.

The survey was split into five key categories (as shown below) - composing a total of 19 questions. There was a mixture of open response, Likert scale, and multiple choice questions, taking approximately 6 minutes to complete. These were distributed to various cycling groups around Glasgow. Survey participants were urged to answer as truthly and honestly as possible. It was not our intention to judge any participants' answers on their safety, legality, or 'sensibility' - instead we only seeked to gather valuable insights into cyclists' behaviours.

All data collected remained compliant with GDPR.


## Demographic
Basis demographic information is needed incase any differences arises between different demographic groups. The following information is collected:
* Age - the age of a user may impact 
* Gender - it is known that many more who identify as men, die each year in motor vehicle crashes. Therefore it is reasonable to assume there may be differences in safety behaviours between men and woman, which may impact their opinions on Tactihelm as a whole.
* Location - different countries have different cycling laws. Furthermore, urban infrastructure can vary between cities. Therefore, it is important to distinguish where a survey participant is located, as to better understand their answers.


## Cycling Habits and Experiences
This section aimed to gather insights into participants own experiences with cycling.
* Cycling frequency (how many hours per week)
* Cycling environment (city roads, cycle paths, countryside, mountains, other)
* Main reasons for cycling (a variety of different reasons which participants may choose as many as applies):
* Have you ever been injured whilst cycling (minor injury, major injury, never)
* If you've been injured, please briefly describe how the accident occurred and if it could have been avoided


## Safety Techniques and Equipment
This section focuses more on safety techniques and equipment used by cyclists.

From the first question, we hope to gather insights into how cyclists keep themselves safe on the road via their own actions. We expect answers to be along the lines of 'staying vigilant', 'keeping visible', and 'clearly communicating my actions'. It asks:
>* When cycling with other road users, what do you do to stay alert of and safe from other road users?

<br>The next questions aims to identify what channels are available to a cyclist for interaction or communication (i.e. are they able to hear, see, or use their hands). It asks participants to read the following statements, then select how often they perform said statements (from never to always). The statements are as follows:
>* I wear a helmet while cycling
>* I listen to music/wear headphones while cycling
>* I take a hand off the handlebars (for less than 3 seconds)
>* I take a hand off the handlebars (for more than 3 seconds)
>* I take my eyes off the road (for less than 3 seconds)
>* I take my eyes off the road (for more than 3 seconds)

It then asks:
>* If you did not answer 'Always' to the statement 'I wear a helmet while cycling', what are your reasons for not wearing a helmet?

<br>Finally, this section asks about what safety equipment and technology participants use. Additionally, if they use a bike radar, if they could state the brand they use and give their opinions on it.
> * Select all the safety equipment and technology that you regularly use while cycling?
>* If you answered yes to having a bike radar, which brand/device do you use?
>* If you answered yes to having a bike radar, how useful do you find it? Does it improve your safety? What do you wish could be improved?


## Other Road Users
This section gathered cyclists thoughts towards other road users while cycling. It asked about whether they felt safe around other vehicles on the road, and what challenges they faced.
>* How often do you share the road with other motorised vehicles?
>* I always feel safe when cycling on the road with other vehicles (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
>* I am always aware when a car is close to me while cycling (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
>* I can always accurately show my intents (i.e. indicate) to other road users while cycling (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
>* What challenges do you experience which makes cycling feel unsafe (give as many reasons as you wish)?
>* What could be done (to cities, vehicles, anything) to make cyclists feel safer?


## Tactihelm
The final section gives a brief description of Tactihelm and then asks participants to share their thoughts. This questions encourages both positive and negative comments to be shared, so that we may properly initially evaluate Tactihelms' desire in the target market.
