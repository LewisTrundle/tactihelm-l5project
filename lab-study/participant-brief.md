# Investigating Vibrotactile Distance Encodings: Participant Brief

Hi! Thank you for volunteering to be part of our lab-study for our Tactihelm project.

**What is Tactihelm?**
Tactihelm is a smart-helmet which provides vibrotactile feedback to a cyclist warning them of an approaching vehicle. The helmet connects to a bike radar, attached to the rear of a users bike. The radar detects the approaching vehicle and communicates this information to the helmet. The helmet uses this information to activate the vibrational motors inside the helmet - activating them in some pattern, from which the user can interpret information about the approaching vehicle.

**What am I doing here today?**
We would like to investigate how information about an approaching vehicle can be effectively encoded and conveyed to a cyclist using vibrotactile cues with the helmet. Using our fixed arrangement of vibrational motors within the helmet, we have defined six encoding schemes (the details of which will be explained during the study). In-order to find out which of these schemes is most appropriate, we need the opinions of cyclists, such as yourself.

**What will I be doing?**
We have prepared various scenarios for you to experience with the helmet, which will simulate the experience of a vehicle approaching from behind. During each of these scenarios, one of the six encoding schemes will be used to vibrate the helmet in a specific way to notify you of the approaching vehicle. During this testing, we will be observing and asking you a variety of questions, so that we can best understand which scheme you find most ideal.

**What data will you collect?**
Most data which we collect during this experiment will be answers to questions in our questionnaire. Additionally, we will be recording various metrics related to your performance during the experiment (such as the number of correct responses). Please note that this experiment is not a test of your ability, rather a test of which encoding scheme is most appropriate.

**What about my data?**
Your data is and will remain completely confidential, and will be used solely for the purpose of this research project. You can of course request that your data be removed at any time, including during or after the study.

**How long will this take?**
Hopefully not too long - no more than 50 minutes. You are of course free to withdraw at any time without prejudice.

**Can I ask questions?**
Yes, you are free to ask whatever questions you like during the study, and the evaluator will attempt to answer them to the best of their knowledge (so long as it wonâ€™t impose on the results of the study). If you have any questions after the study, please feel free to reach out to [2469635t@student.gla.ac.uk](mailto:2469635t@student.gla.ac.uk).

**Consent**
By continuing with this study, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the above information, and you consent to participate in this study.
