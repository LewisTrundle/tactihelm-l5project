# Investigating Vibrotactile Distance Encodings: Participant Brief

Hi! Thank you for volunteering to be part of a pre-user study for our Tactihelm project.

**What is Tactihelm?**
Tactihelm is a smart-helmet which provides vibrotactile feedback to a cyclist warning them of an approaching vehicle. The helmet connects to a bike radar, attached to the rear of a users bike. The radar detects the approaching vehicle and communicates this information to the helmet. The helmet uses this information to activate the vibrational motors inside the helmet - activating them in some pattern, from which the user can interpret information about the approaching vehicle.

**What am I doing here today?**
What we would like to investigate in this study is how information about an approaching vehicle can be effectively encoded and conveyed to the cyclist using vibrotactile cues with the helmet. Using our fixed arrangement of vibrational motors within the helmet, we have defined six encoding schemes, which you will be testing in-order to find out which is most appropriate for TactiHelm.

**How long will this take?**
Hopefully not too long - no more than 45 minutes. You are of course free to withdraw at any time, without any repercussions.

**What will happen with my data?**
Your responses are and will remain completely confidential, and will be used solely for the purpose of this research project. You can of course request that your data be removed at any time, including during or after the study.

**Can I ask questions?**
Yes, you are free to ask whatever questions you like during the study, and the evaluator will attempt to answer them to the best of their knowledge (so long as it wonâ€™t impose on the results of the study). If you have any questions after the study, please feel free to reach out to [2469635t@student.gla.ac.uk](mailto:2469635t@student.gla.ac.uk).

**Consent**
By continuing with this study, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the above information, and you consent to participate in this pilot study.

## Setup and Explanation

### Helmet Fitting

Please put the helmet on your head and adjust the tightness as necessary, until you are comfortable with the placement.

### Tactors

Three vibration motors (tactors) have been placed inside the helmet, equidistant along the midline of the head, as shown in the [provided diagram](../design/head-regions.pdf). These tactors will now be activated individually so you can feel where they are located. If needed, please feel free to ask the evaluator to activate a tactor again.

### Following Distance

We believe an appropriate way of warning a cyclist of an approaching vehicle, is to convey to them the following distance of the vehicle behind. Despite being called the following distance, this is actually a measure of the time it would take the vehicle following behind to reach your location, if you were to suddenly stop. In this lab-study, we quantise this metric into three discrete categories: far, near, and imminent. The encoding schemes which you will be evaluating, each have a unique way of communicating these distances to a cyclist using vibrotactile cues, delivered using the three vibration motors in the helmet.

### Questionnaire - Part 1

Before we go on to describe and evaluate the encoding schemes, please follow the link and complete the first section of the questionnaire: [TactiHelm - Lab Study Questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/e/G1WUgtXXxy).

Once this is done, please navigate to the next part of the study: [Experiment Session](./experiment-session.md).
