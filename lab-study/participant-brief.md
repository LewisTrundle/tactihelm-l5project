# Investigating Vibrotactile Distance Encodings: Participant Brief

Hi! Thank you for volunteering to be part of a pre-user study for our Tactihelm project.

**What is Tactihelm?**
Tactihelm is a smart-helmet which provides **vibrotactile feedback** to a cyclist warning them of **approaching vehicles**. The helmet connects to a **bike radar** attached to the back of a users bike, which in turn sends data to the helmet, about the distance and speed of an approaching vehicle.
**What am I doing here today?**
In-order to safely warn a cyclist of the **distance** and **speed** of an approaching vehicle, we need to understand how we can communicate these properties using only vibrations on our helmet.
To do this, we will be analysing and evaluating your understanding of our pre-set encoding schemes.
**How long will this take?**
Hopefully not too long - no more than 30 minutes. You are of course free to withdraw at any time, without any repercussions.
**What will happen with my data?**
Your responses are and will remain completely confidential, and will be used solely for the purpose of this research project. You can of course request that your data be removed at any time, including after the study.
**Can I ask questions?**
Yes, you are free to ask whatever questions you like during the study, and the evaluator will attempt to answer them to the best of their knowledge (so long as it wonâ€™t impose on the results of the study). If you have any questions after the study, please feel free to reach out to [2469635t@student.gla.ac.uk](mailto:2469635t@student.gla.ac.uk).
