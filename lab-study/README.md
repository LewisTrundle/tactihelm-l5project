## Goal of the Study

The goal of this experiment is to investigate how the distance of an approaching vehicle can be effectively encoded and conveyed to a cyclist using vibrotactile cues with the TactiHelm helmet. We aim to compare six defined encoding schemes to identify which is most suitable. This evaluation investigates the specified questions:

1. Is the sagittal plane of the scalp a suitable location for vibrotactile stimulation, for a helmet-based vibrotactile display?
2. Which combination of location-based and duration-based encodings helps participants make the fewest amount of information perception/interpretation errors, in our described system?
3. What are common errors which participants make when perceiving/interpreting vibrotactile information using a helmet-based display?

To answer the first question, we investigate how perception of vibrotactile stimulation varies across the three stimuli loci in our described system. To answer the second question, we systematically evaluate the perception/interpretation of six different encoding schemes - created from three location-based schemes and two duration-based schemes. Finally, to answer the third question, we gather qualitative feedback from participants to understand how they perceive the given vibrotactile stimuli.

## Experiment Design

Our experiment consists of two independent variables - the vibration location and the vibration duration. The vibration location describes which vibrational motors should be activated and has three distinct levels, while the vibration duration describes how many times a vibrational cue should be repeated and has two distinct levels. The distance information is presented by both the location and duration of a vibrotactile cue. Together these two variables create six unique experimental conditions, known as the distance encoding schemes.

To compare these six schemes, we used a within-subjects design, where each participant evaluated every encoding scheme under lab conditions. The evaluation of each scheme was composed of three trials. During a trial, a vibrotactile cue representing a distance would be sent to the helmet every five seconds. Participants would then have to state which distance they believed was just conveyed. The first trial was a short training phase, aimed to quickly train participants on how to interpret the encoding scheme. The second and third trials were part of the data gathering phase, were participants' results would be recorded without correction. This totalled to 18 trials for each participant. Trials were consistent in length: every training trial had a total of seven cues, whereas every data gathering trial had 12 cues, with an equal split of different distances. The order in which participants evaluated the schemes was balanced using a balanced latin square. The order of the trials remained constant.

### Dependent Measures

Following our research questions for this study, we define our dependent measures as the usability of the encoding schemes and the number of information perception errors.

*Information perception errors: Information perception errors are the number of errors made by the participant in identifying the category of distance. We measure the number of participants’ wrong responses on the categories of distance for quantifying how many errors they made in perceiving the distance information. Furthermore, we analyzed how they interpreted the categories of distance*

We define usability in terms of the usefullness, distinguishability, interpretability, intuitiveness, and perceived length, of a set of vibrotactile cues.

Usability data is gotten from interviews and info perception is gotten from trials.

#### Questionnaires

#### Interviews

### Subjects and Apparatus

18 participants were recruited for the study, all of which were between the ages of 16 and 24. Although not recorded, the density of participants' hair varied - possibly affecting the perception of vibrotactile stimuli. Few participants were avid cyclists, with only x% stating they cycling more than x hours per week.

### Procedure

## Results

The study was completed by x respondents, all aged 16-24 years old. 

90% of respondents answered saying they cycle more than one hour a week, with 42.73% of
respondents cycling 7+ hours a week

### Comparing Schemes

These questions inform us about the user's preference and allow us to compare the usability of each scheme.

**Preference**
Which scheme did participants prefer the most? Rank them from 1-6

**Distinguishability**
How easy was it to distinguish between different cues for each scheme (i.e where you confused as to which distance was being conveyed)?
Do you have any further comments regarding the distinguishability of the schemes?

**Interpretation**
Did you find it easy to interpret the meaning of the signals in relation to the approaching vehicle's distance (i.e. did you know which distance a cue was conveying)?
Do you have any further comments regarding the interpretation of the schemes?

**Learnability**
How easy did you find learning each encoding scheme (i.e. were the cues intuitive and easy to understand)?
Do you have any further comments regarding the ease of learning of the schemes?

**Length of Cues**
How did you find the length of the vibrotactile cues for each scheme (i.e. did you find that the cues were too short or too long)?
Do you have any further comments regarding the length of cues of the schemes?

**Information Perception**
*"Information perception errors: Information perception errors are the number of errors made by the participant in identifying the category of distance. We measure the number of
participants’ wrong responses on the categories of distance
for quantifying how many errors they made in perceiving the
distance information. Furthermore, we analyzed how they
interpreted the categories of distance."*

### Helmet and Tactors

These questions inform us whether we need to make changes to the placement of the tactors or to other factors, such as the intensity.

**Perception**
How easy was it to perceive signals for each tactor (i.e. did you struggle to feel signals from any tactor, or were they ever too strong)?
Do you have any further comments regarding the perception of the tactors?

### Other Comments

**Perceived Safety and Awareness**
To what extent did the helmet's feedback enhance your confidence in navigating traffic safely?
Did you feel more aware of potential hazards and dangers on the road with the helmet's assistance?
How would you rate the overall impact of the helmet on your sense of safety while cycling?

Not measurable with this experiment.

**Engagement with Environment**
Not measurable with this experiment.

**Adaptability to Different Environments**
e.g. Urban, mountain, etc. Not measurable with this experiment.

**Comparison with Visual and Auditory Modalities**
How effective do you believe each encoding scheme was in alerting you to the presence of an approaching vehicle?
Did you feel adequately warned about the approaching vehicle with each scheme?

Not measurable with this experiment.

**Distraction**
Were there any instances where you felt the helmet's feedback was insufficient or overwhelming?

Not measurable with this experiment.

**Categories of Distance**
Do you have any further comments regarding the categories of following distance? Do you think this would be an appropriate indicator of how close a car is to you?

**Comfort**
Please rate how comfortable the helmet felt whilst on your head.
Do you have any further comments regarding the comfort of the helmet?

**Suggestions for Further Improvement**
Based on your experience today, what improvements or additional features would you recommend for future iterations of the helmet?

## Pros and Limitations

Unlike other studies which directly compare encoding schemes, our study systematically varies two components which when combined, create an encoding scheme.

Lab-based instead of real, so hard to actually measure impact.

Trials were split in two to avoid fatigue and missing answers carrying more impact.

Training was good idea

participants were fatigued by end of experiment but latin square mitigated these effects.

- small sample size
- not all participants were avid cyclists
