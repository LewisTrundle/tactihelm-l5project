# Lab Study - Investigating Vibrotactile Distance Encodings

## Goal of the Study

The goal of this experiment is to identify which vibrational scheme is most suitable for use for the TactiHelm project.

## Experiment Design

### Independent Variables

### Dependent Variables

### Subjects

### Apparatus

## Procedure


Discrete and not continuous, because there are only so many distinguishable levels - even for temporal aspects.
Also a cyclist doesn't need to know precisly where the vehicle is. The only thing that matters is when a near vehicle becomes imminent - they do not need to track the vehicle as this would be too much cognitive effort

For following distance, the app could connect to weather api to get the weather conditions and increase to 4s if necessary.
