# Lab Study - Investigating Vibrotactile Distance Encodings

## Goal of the Study

The goal of this experiment is to investigate how information about an approaching vehicle can be effectively encoded and conveyed to a cyclist using vibrotactile cues with the TaciHelm helmet. We aim to compare six defined encoding schemes to identify which is most suitable. This evaluation investigates the specified questions:

1. Which combinations of pattern-based and rhythm-based encodings are most usable for our proposed system?
2. Which combinations of pattern-based and rhythm-based encodings help the cyclist make the least amount of perception errors?
3. Is a linear configuration of vibrotactile motors along the midline of the head, suitable for a helmet-based display?
4. Can the sagittal plane of the human body be used for a vibrotactile display?
5. Is following distance a suitable metric to appropriately alert participants of an approaching vehicle?
6. Is our categorisation of following distance into far, near, and imminent, appropriate for our proposed system?

## Experiment Design

Our experiment consists of one independent variable - the following distance encoding scheme. This variable has six different levels - the combinations of three pattern schemes and two duration schemes. Encoding schemes present different vibrotactile cues to the participant, depending on the following distance of the approaching  vehicle. The following distance is the distance of the vehicle, divided by its speed. We used a within-subjects design, where each participant experienced six simulated cycling scenarios in lab conditions. The order of experimental conditions (the encoding schemes) was balanced using a balanced latin square. The order in which the participants experiences the scenarios remained constant.

### Dependent Variables

### Subjects

We seek to recruit roughly 10 participants for the study. Although factors such as age and hair density may affect the perception of vibrotactile stimuli, we do not seek to discriminate in this study.

### Procedure

## Results

### Comparing Schemes

These questions inform us about the user's preference and allow us to compare the usability of each scheme.

**Preference**
Which scheme did participants prefer the most? Rank them from 1-6

**Distinguishability**
How easy was it to distinguish between different cues for each scheme (i.e where you confused as to which distance was being conveyed)?
Do you have any further comments regarding the distinguishability of the schemes?

**Interpretation**
Did you find it easy to interpret the meaning of the signals in relation to the approaching vehicle's distance (i.e. did you know which distance a cue was conveying)?
Do you have any further comments regarding the interpretation of the schemes?

**Learnability**
How easy did you find learning each encoding scheme (i.e. were the cues intuitive and easy to understand)?
Do you have any further comments regarding the ease of learning of the schemes?

**Length of Cues**
How did you find the length of the vibrotactile cues for each scheme (i.e. did you find that the cues were too short or too long)?
Do you have any further comments regarding the length of cues of the schemes?

**Information Perception**
*"Information perception errors: Information perception errors are the number of errors made by the participant in identifying the category of distance. We measure the number of
participantsâ€™ wrong responses on the categories of distance
for quantifying how many errors they made in perceiving the
distance information. Furthermore, we analyzed how they
interpreted the categories of distance."*

### Helmet and Tactors

These questions inform us whether we need to make changes to the placement of the tactors or to other factors, such as the intensity.

**Perception**
How easy was it to perceive signals for each tactor (i.e. did you struggle to feel signals from any tactor, or were they ever too strong)?
Do you have any further comments regarding the perception of the tactors?

### Other Comments

**Perceived Safety and Awareness**
To what extent did the helmet's feedback enhance your confidence in navigating traffic safely?
Did you feel more aware of potential hazards and dangers on the road with the helmet's assistance?
How would you rate the overall impact of the helmet on your sense of safety while cycling?

Not measurable with this experiment.

**Engagement with Environment**
Not measurable with this experiment.

**Adaptability to Different Environments**
e.g. Urban, mountain, etc. Not measurable with this experiment.

**Comparison with Visual and Auditory Modalities**
How effective do you believe each encoding scheme was in alerting you to the presence of an approaching vehicle?
Did you feel adequately warned about the approaching vehicle with each scheme?

Not measurable with this experiment.

**Distraction**
Were there any instances where you felt the helmet's feedback was insufficient or overwhelming?

Not measurable with this experiment.

**Categories of Distance**
Do you have any further comments regarding the categories of following distance? Do you think this would be an appropriate indicator of how close a car is to you?

**Comfort**
Please rate how comfortable the helmet felt whilst on your head.
Do you have any further comments regarding the comfort of the helmet?

**Suggestions for Further Improvement**
Based on your experience today, what improvements or additional features would you recommend for future iterations of the helmet?
