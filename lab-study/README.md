## Goal of the Study

The goal of this experiment is to investigate how the distance of an approaching vehicle can be effectively encoded and conveyed to a cyclist using vibrotactile cues with the TactiHelm helmet. We aim to compare six defined encoding schemes to identify which is most suitable. This evaluation investigates the specified questions:

1. Is the sagittal plane of the scalp a suitable location for vibrotactile stimulation, for a helmet-based vibrotactile display?
2. Which combination of location-based and duration-based encodings helps participants make the fewest amount of information perception/interpretation errors, in our described system?
3. What are common errors which participants make when perceiving/interpreting vibrotactile information using a helmet-based display?
4. Do people typically understand what the term *"following distance"* means and what values would relate to the terms *far*, *near*, and *imminent*?

To answer the first question, we investigate how perception of vibrotactile stimulation varies across the three stimuli loci in our described system. To answer the second question, we systematically evaluate the perception/interpretation of six different encoding schemes - created from three location-based schemes and two duration-based schemes. Finally, to answer the third question, we gather qualitative feedback from participants to understand how they perceive the given vibrotactile stimuli.

## Experiment Design

Our experiment consists of two independent variables - the vibration location and the vibration duration. The vibration location describes which vibrational motors should be activated and has three distinct levels, while the vibration duration describes how many times a vibrational cue should be repeated and has two distinct levels. The distance information is presented by both the location and duration of a vibrotactile cue. Together these two variables create six unique experimental conditions, known as the distance encoding schemes.

To compare these six schemes, we used a within-subjects design, where each participant evaluated every encoding scheme under lab conditions. The evaluation of each scheme was composed of three trials. During a trial, a vibrotactile cue representing a distance would be sent to the helmet every five seconds. Participants would then have to state which distance they believed was just conveyed. The first trial was a short training phase, aimed to quickly train participants on how to interpret the encoding scheme. The second and third trials were part of the data gathering phase, were participants' results would be recorded without correction. This totalled to 18 trials for each participant. Trials were consistent in length: every training trial had a total of seven cues, whereas every data gathering trial had 12 cues, with an equal split of different distances. The order in which participants evaluated the schemes was balanced using a balanced latin square. The order of the trials remained constant.

### Dependent Measures

Following our research questions for this study, we define our dependent measures as the usability of the encoding schemes and the number of information perception errors.

*Information perception errors: Information perception errors are the number of errors made by the participant in identifying the category of distance. We measure the number of participantsâ€™ wrong responses on the categories of distance for quantifying how many errors they made in perceiving the distance information. Furthermore, we analyzed how they interpreted the categories of distance*

We define usability in terms of the usefullness, distinguishability, interpretability, intuitiveness, and perceived length, of a set of vibrotactile cues.

Usability data is gotten from interviews and info perception is gotten from trials.

### Subjects and Apparatus

20 participants were recruited for the study, all aged 16-24 years old. Although not recorded, the density of participants' hair varied - possibly affecting the perception of vibrotactile stimuli. Few participants were avid cyclists, with only 30% stating they cycling more than 1 hour per week, and half of those (15%) cycling more than seven hours a week. However, we note that participants did not have to be ardent cyclists for the purposes of this study, as the experiment focused on collecting data regarding the perception of the head.

Malfunction in helmet means P10 is void and P13 couldn't fit.

### Procedure

## Results

### Perception of Tactors

From our initial explanation, participants generally understood how the layout of the tactors related to the distance of an approaching vehicle, with 85% correctly answering that the tactor at the back of the head would be activated if a detected vehicle was *far*, *"The layout made sense in relation to the problem and the tactors are sufficiently powerful"* [P7]. Although most participants stated they were able to distinguish between all three tactors, many said it was often difficult to do so with the front and middle ones, *"I was able to distinguish location on my head. However the middle and front tactors were much harder to feel than the back one"* [P3].

This could have been because of their location and spacing. Multiple participants stated that the tactors often felt too close to eachother, and that they expected the front tactor to be closer to the forehead, *"I expected the middle one to be where the front one is and the front one to be more towards the forehead"* [P11]. Participants also generally found these two tactors less perceptible, as seen in Figure [BOX CHART OF Q17]. There are multiple reasons as to why this might be. As previously discussed, the front of the scalp is less perceptible than the back [CITE AND OR REFER TO PREVIOUS SECTION]. Additionally, variance in head size meant that some participants' scalp pressed less against the top of the helmet than others, leading to a lesser perceived intensity. As put by participant 7, *"I found it hard to distinguish between the front and mid tactors, but I think this is a comment on the ergonomics of the helmet, not of the tactor placement"*. Regarding the comfort of the helmet, participants gave an average rating of 7.15 out of 10 for its' comfortableness, with many commenting that its weight and small size caused uncomfortable pressure points, such as at the back of the head.

Because of the difficulty in perception, multiple participants stated they relied on the sound of the vibration rather than the tactile feeling. An improved experiment design would have had participants wear noise cancelling headphones to block this sensory channel [CITE EXAMPLE] - we acknowledge this as a limitation in our study.

### Understanding of Following Distance

From our initial explanation of the following distance, few participants (25%) correctly understood that it was in-fact a measure of time and hence typically measured in seconds. From this group, a variety of answers were provided, regarding what value the distance would be, given a vehicle was *imminent*, ranging from one to five seconds [2s IS THE CORRECT ANSWER, CITE]. Of the 75% of participants who did not correctly understand, their answers were typically measured using either metres or car/bike lengths. These ranged from one to five metres or one to two car/bike lengths. These answers did not mention what speed the vehicle would be travelling at. However, as previously mentioned, it is important to note that the majority of participants were not avid cyclists, meaning their interpretation of this term may differ from our target group. When asked whether or not they believed the following distance would be an appropriate indicator of an approaching vehicle, most participants agreed that it would be, and agreed with the categorisation of this metric into three values.

### Comparing Encoding Schemes

#### Rankings

As seen from the rankings, Wave Varying was ranked first, followed closely by Wall Varying, then Singular Varying, as seen in Figure [FIGURE OF RANKINGS]. All the varyings were preferred over the constants.

For the statement: "If I were cycling, this scheme would be useful in alerting me of an approaching vehicle from behind", participants agreed that most of them would be useful except from Singular Constant and Wall Constant.

#### Distinguishability and Interpretation

For the statement: "It was easy to distinguish between different cues (vibrations for different distances)" people disagreed with this for all the constants, particularly the wall. All the varying was somewhat similar results.
INTERPRETATION SECTION IS JUST THE SAME STUFF.

Singular:
- Singular constant and varying meant there was less noise that having multiple tactors at once but this also means the overall vibration strength was always weaker even if a vehicle distance was imminant.
- With singular it was easier to feel the exact areas, but still preferred to count using varying.
- Single constant could be very easy to miss or misinterpret
- single constant was almost impossible I thought.
- I found myself relying on the sound of the different vibrations for distinguishing between them in the single constant scheme. I can imagine this would be harder if i was in a scenario where i coudnt hear them (e.g. on a bike on a road!)

Wall:
- wall constant is extremely hard to distinguish between distances - particularly near and imminent
- Wall varying helped to distinguish between imminent and near threats, much more understandable

Wave:
- Wave constant was hard compared to wave varying - as it doesn't give the user a second chance to pay attention to what area of the helmet was vibrating.
- For wave constant I really struggled to notice where on my head it was vibrating, might be a hair or me problem - BECAUSE OF FUNNELLING, PARTICIPANTS WOULDNT FEEL IT IN ONE LOCATION BUT ACROSS THEIR HEAD.

Other:
- hard to distinguish between front and imminent
- varying meant it was much easier to count, rather than feel the exact area. With Constant it was much harder.
- Easy to identify though the varying makes it easier

SUMMARY:

- Constants can be easily missed or misinterpreted ("Single constant could be very easy to miss or misinterpret") due to the weaker perceived intensity ("the overall vibration strength was always weaker even if a vehicle distance was imminant.").

- Participants also said they relied heavily on the sound of vibrations for constant schemes.

- It was much easier to count using varying, rather than try and focus on the location of a vibration ("I had to use less cognitive power"). This is particularly true with the wall and wave constant schemes as participants struggled to identify the location on their head, hence guessed distance incorrectly [BACK UP WITH EVIDENCE]. This would be because of vibration illusions, whereas with singular, the location of a veridical signal is esaier to identify ("With singular it was easier to feel the exact areas").

#### Ease of Learning

All rated positively.

- "Iâ€™d say thereâ€™s little benefit to varying singular, wave, or wall. The key information is also contained in the number of vibrations, which is clear enough in all three. As sensor 2 (near) was the strongest, I feel this could vary through 1, 2, and 3 vibrations to convey as much information as these methods (with less technology needed)"

- I liked the idea of moving closer to front of head, having a sort of feeling of something is getting closer behind me

- Wave vibrations were much easier to learn, and was more comfortable to use and pick up.

#### Length of Cues

- Wave Constant was too short to definitively know what the distance was.

- Wall constant was hard to get correct if not concentrating.

- All the constants don't give enough time to interpret.

- Perhaps increasing/decreasing length depending on following distance could be a different scheme to consider

- Generally, I think all of the cues should be a bit longer. Each individual pulse could be slightly longer, for the singular schemes.

## Conclusions

Further spaced tactors
better designed helmet which is lighter and doesn't have pressure points.

## Pros and Limitations

Unlike other studies which directly compare encoding schemes, our study systematically varies two components which when combined, create an encoding scheme.

Lab-based instead of real, so hard to actually measure impact.

Trials were split in two to avoid fatigue and missing answers carrying more impact.

Training was good idea

participants were fatigued by end of experiment but latin square mitigated these effects.

- small sample size
- not all participants were avid cyclists
