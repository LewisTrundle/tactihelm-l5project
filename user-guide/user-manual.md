### TactiHelm Controller

The TactiHelm controller application is how you can connect to the helmet and bike radar and start receiving vibrations. The app is needed to allow the bike radar to communicate with the helmet: when the radar detects a vehicle, it sends this information to the app, the app then sends this information to the helmet.

**Note that this app only works on Android.**
