## Goal of the Study

The goal of this experiment is to evaluate our developed TactiHelm system in the real-world. Specifically, we aim to assess its usability and effectiveness in warning users of the presence and proximity of approaching vehicles behind them, all within a naturalistic setting. Through this study, we seek to answer the following questions:

1. Can participants accurately perceive and interpret vibrotactile signals on the scalp whilst cycling?
2. Does the use of TactiHelm improve participants perceived safety and comfort whilst cycling with other road vehicles?
3. Is following distance a suitable metric to appropriately alert participants of an approaching vehicle?
4. Is our categorisation of following distance into far, near, and imminent, appropriate for our proposed safety system?

## Experiment Design

### Dependent Measures

### Subjects and Apparatus

Only recruit participants with a moderate cycling ability.

Similarly to the lab study, we seek to recruit roughly 10 participants of any demographic. Although arguably, it may be more beneficial to recruit participants which cycle frequently, TactiHelm should be able to support even novice cyclists. The full TactiHelm system as described in Section 3.1 will be used.

Distance will be coded using the best scheme found in the aforementioned lab study. For internal validity, we aim to use the same bike for every experiment. This bike will have a microphone and camera attached, to capture both video and audio footage of participants
