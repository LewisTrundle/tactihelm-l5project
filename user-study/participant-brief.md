# TactiHelm User Study: Participant Brief

Hi! Thank you for volunteering to be part of the user-study for our TactiHelm project.

**What is TactiHelm?**
TactiHelm is a smart-helmet which provides vibrotactile feedback to a cyclist warning them of an approaching vehicle. The helmet connects to a bike radar, attached to the rear of a users bike. The radar detects the approaching vehicle and communicates this information to the helmet. The helmet uses this information to activate the vibrational motors inside the helmet - activating them in some pattern, from which the cyclist can interpret information about the approaching vehicle.

**What am I doing here today?**
We would like to evaluate how our developed TactiHelm system works in the real-world. In-order to do this, we need the help of people, such as yourself, who are willing to try on and wear TactiHelm during an actual bike ride. By doing this, we hope to understand how effective our helmet is in warning cyclists of the presence and proximity of approaching vehicles behind them.

**What will I be doing?**
Your participation in this study will take place over the course of today, tomorrow, and one further day. Your primary task will be to simply cycle your commute between your workplace and residence as you normally would, but equipped with the TactiHelm system. We ask that during your commute, you perform a think-aloud evaluation of the system (i.e. say your thoughts out-loud). Further guidance on this will be explained shortly. After the completion of your second commute, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire, followed by a short interview with the evaluator. Finally, we will ask that you complete one more commute between your workplace and residence, without the use of TactiHelm. This will not require a think-aloud evaluation, instead we will ask you to complete a small section of the questionnaire again, after which, your participation in this study is complete, and you will be properly debriefed.

The task list is as follows:

1. cycle from **work to home** using TactiHelm and performing think-aloud.
2. cycle from **home to work** using TactiHelm and performing think-aloud.
3. complete questionnaires and interview and return equipment.
4. cycle from **home to work** normally and complete NASA-TLX questionnaire.

Task 1 will be performed the day you are given TactiHelm. Tasks 2 and 3 will be performed the day after you are given TactiHelm. Task 4 can be performed any day within seven days of performing the previous tasks. Please note that this experiment is not a test of your ability.

**What data will you collect?**
