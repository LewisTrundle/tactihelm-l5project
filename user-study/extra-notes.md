whenever an event occurs. We define an event as one of the following: (1) the helmet vibrates, (2) they detect a vehicle behind them, (3) the vehicle behind them has 

This is defined as: 

What do you see? and What do you feel?
or
Any else which is relevant

if you see a car, how close is it?
if you feel a vibration, what do you think it's conveying?

Examples:
- I see a car really close to me but I didn't feel the helmet vibrate
- I felt the helmet vibrate that a car is really close, and I see that it is.







- did the bike radar detect vehicles?
  - I see a car but it didn't vibrate
  - It vibrated but I don't see a car
  - I see a car and it vibrated

- when it vibrates


  - car was approaching but didn't vibrate at all
  - car was approaching but I think it vibrated wrongly / didn't appropriately warn me
  - it vibrated but I didn't see any car
  - it vibrated correctly.
- if the helmet vibrated what do you think it warned you of?

Examples of potential scenarios and thoughts were provided.

when they feel the helmet vibrate, think-aloud what , and if it is safe and appropriate to do so, perform a shoulder.

if they spot an approaching vehicle, has the helmet appropriately warned them?
Examples:
- I see a vehicle behind me... Oh yeah the helmet has vibrated... I think the helmet told me properly where the car was.
- there's a vehicle right behind me but the helmet didn't warn me
- I think there's a vehicle very close to me, but my helmet says it's far away.

Any other:
- the helmet is comfy/uncomfy
- it wouldv'e been nice if the helmet could've warned me of that
- it's easy/difficult to feel these vibrations


They don't have to strictly use the words: far, near, imminent.
