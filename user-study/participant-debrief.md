# TactiHelm User Study: Participant Debrief

The aim of this experiment was to evaluate how our developed TactiHelm system works in the real-world. In-order to do this, we need the help of people, such as yourself, who are willing to try on and wear TactiHelm during an actual bike ride. By doing this, we hope to understand how effective our helmet is in warning cyclists of the presence and proximity of approaching vehicles behind them.

As stated at the beginning, we wanted to gather your thoughts and opinions on how effective this system works in real-life. By gathering audio captured during your commutes, feedback from the questionnaire and interview, and information about your commute, we hope to be able to analyse your results and make improve to the TactiHelm system for future versions.

Once again, we would like to thank you for helping us with this study. Your information is invaluable to the success of this project.

You are welcome to ask as many questions as you like. Please take a note of my email address [2469635t@student.gla.ac.uk](mailto:2469635t@student.gla.ac.uk) and please let us know if you have any further questions about this experiment.
