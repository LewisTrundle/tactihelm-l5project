# TactiHelm User Study: Participant Debrief

The aim of this experiment was to investigate how information about an approaching vehicle can be effectively encoded and conveyed to a cyclist using vibrotactile cues with the TaciHelm helmet.

As stated at the beginning, we wanted to gather your opinions about which of our six defined encoding schemes you found most appropriate for TactiHelm. Additionally, we collected your opinions about the general comfort of the helmet and your understanding of what following distance was.

Once again, we would like to thank you for helping us with this study. Your information is invaluable to the success of this project. Before we end, do you have any further comments or questions about the experiment.

Please take a note of my email address [2469635t@student.gla.ac.uk](mailto:2469635t@student.gla.ac.uk) and please let us know if you have any further questions about this experiment.

Thank you!
