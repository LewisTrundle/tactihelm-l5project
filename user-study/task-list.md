You will be asked a variety of questions regarding your two commutes. Some questions will be regarding both of them, while other questions will only be about your second commute. Please complete this questionnaire as soon as possible after your second commute, so that your experience is still fresh in your mind. Please answer truthfully and honestly.

## Task 4: Interview

After your commutes and completion of the questionnaire, you will be asked to come in for an interview with the evaluator. This will be relatively short (no more than 15 minutes) and is just for us to more deeply understand your experience with TactiHelm.

**Please bring all the equipment with you to return.**

## Task 5: Final Commute and Questionnaire

Your final task is to complete one more commute but without TactiHelm. Please complete this commute within seven days of your interview. Immediately after your commute, we would ask that you complete part of the questionnaire again.
