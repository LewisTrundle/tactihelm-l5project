# TactiHelm User Study: Information Sheet

## Setup and Equipment

### What is TactiHelm?

TactiHelm is a smart-helmet which provides vibrotactile feedback to a cyclist warning them of an approaching vehicle. The helmet connects to a bike radar, attached to the rear of a user's bike. The radar detects the approaching vehicle and communicates this information to the helmet. The helmet uses this information to activate the vibrational motors inside the helmet - activating them in some pattern, from which the cyclist can interpret information about the approaching vehicle.

### The Helmet

Please try on the helmet and adjust the tightness as necessary, until you are comfortable with the placement.

Three vibration motors (tactors) have been placed inside the helmet, equidistant along the midline of the head, as shown in the [provided diagram](../design/head-regions.pdf). These tactors will now be activated individually so you can feel where they are located. If needed, please feel free to ask the evaluator to activate a tactor again.

### Encoding Distance Using Vibrations

We believe an appropriate way of warning a cyclist of an approaching vehicle, is to convey to them the *following distance* of the vehicle behind. Despite being called the *following distance*, this is actually a measure of the time it would take the vehicle following behind to reach your location, if you were to suddenly stop. In this study, we have split this metric into three discrete categories: *far*, *near*, and *imminent*. These three values are used to decide how to vibrate the helmet.

The helmet will vibrate using what's called a **wave pattern**. This vibrates all the tactors (starting at the rear) in sequence, up to a specific point, relative to the detected distance. Hence the name 'Wave', as the tactors are activated like a wave across your scalp. In addition to this, the vibrational pattern has a **varying duration**. This means the number of times the vibrational pattern repeats, depends on the distance. This is described in the table below. The evaluator will now activate the vibrational cue for each distance. If needed, please feel free to ask the evaluator to activate a cue again.

| Distance |   Activated Tactors  |
|:--------:|:--------------------:|
|    Far   |         Rear (x1 time)        |
|   Near   |    Rear **then** Mid (x2 times)  |
| Imminent | Rear, **then** Mid, **then** Front (x3 times) |

The helmet will only vibrate under two conditions:

- a vehicle is first detected.
- the following distance of the closest detected vehicle changes category.

## User Manual

Please ensure that you read the [user manual](./user-manual.md) before using TactiHelm.

## Performing the Evaluation

### What is a Think-Aloud Evaluation?

A think-aloud evaluation is a method where you verbalize their thoughts, perceptions, actions, and feelings as they occur. For this study, we're asking you to do this whilst you cycle with TactiHelm in traffic. This continuous verbal feedback will help us capture your real-time interpretation of the helmet's vibrational cues and your situational awareness.

### What should I talk about?

While cycling, you'll may encounter a variety of different events, for example:

- The helmet vibrates to indicate the proximity of an approaching vehicle (far, near, imminent).
- You visually detect a vehicle approaching from behind.
- Any other relevant observations or feelings you experience during the ride.

Whenever you have any thought regarding your cycling experience, please audibly articulate them. It may help to describe:

- What you see: The presence, distance, and speed of vehicles around you.
- What you physically feel: Can you feel the helmet vibrate? Can you interpret the vibrational cues?
- What you mentally feel: Do you feel safe? Do you feel aware of what's around you? Are you having to concentrate more or less than usual?
- Any additional observations: Is the helmet comfortable? Were there any discrepancies between what you feel and what you see.

Examples of Think-Aloud Comments:

- "I see a car really close to me... but I didn't feel the helmet vibrate."
- "The helmet vibrated... I think it means a car is really close, and I see that it is."
- "I felt the helmet vibrate a far away distance... but I see a car really close to me."
- "The helmet feels a bit light/heavy."
- "I think the helmet might have vibrated, but I'm having to concentrate to feel it."

### Important Tips

- First and foremost, your safety is the most important. Please do not behave any differently from how you normally would, and focus on safe cycling.
- There's no need to try and filter any of your thoughts. We are not assessing you on correct grammar, nor the sensibility and correctness of your answers and cycling. Please try and speak naturally and unfiltered so that you can focus on your cycling.
- Please feel free to express any thoughts, even if they seem unrelated or trivial. Sometimes, minor observations lead to significant insights.

## Last Steps

It is important that before we finish this briefing session, you understand the following. Please carefully read each statement and tell the evaluator whether you agree with each point.

- You know what TactiHelm is and understand how, why, and when it will vibrate.
- You feel comfortable wearing the helmet during your commutes and you can feel the vibrations.
- You understand your required tasks for this study.
- You know how to turn on and off the helmet.
- You know how to turn on and off the bike radar and how to attach it to your bike.
- You know how to turn on and off the headset and how to put it on.
- You have the Voice Recorder app, Ride with GPS app, and TactiHelm Controller app downloaded on your mobile device.
- (If given a temporary device) you know the passcode to the mobile device.
- You know how to use the controller app to connect using Bluetooth to the helmet and bike radar.
- You know how to use the controller app to start and stop receiving vibrations.
- You know how to start and stop recording your voice for the think-aloud evaluation.
- You know how to perform a think-aloud evaluation.
- You know how to record the GPS data of your commute.
- You know who to contact if you have any questions.
- You know how to put the rain cover on the helmet.
- You know where look in your participant pack if you forget any of the above.
- You understand to cycle as you normally would and to prioritise your own safety over the evaluation.
