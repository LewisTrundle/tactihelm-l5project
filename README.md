# TactiHelm L5project

TactiHelm is a vibrotactile, helmet-based, hazard-notification system, designed to warn cyclists of approaching vehicles. It combines a Garmin Varia RTL515 bike radar with a modified cycling helmet, to detect approaching vehicles and convey their approach using vibrotactile cues delivered from the helmet.
